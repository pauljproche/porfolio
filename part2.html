        <p>
            I decided to take this web programming class because I'm fascinated 
            by the world of technology and its impact on our lives. I believe that
            understanding web programming is crucial in today's digital age, and I
            want to equip myself with the skills to create engaging websites and 
            develop innovative web applications. Personally, I'm excited about the 
            creative possibilities that come with web programming, such as building
            interactive user interfaces and implementing dynamic functionalities.
            I have experience with HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL and I'm familiar with 
            frameworks like React and Angular. I'm eager to expand my knowledge 
            and delve deeper into the world of software development through this 
            class.

        <p> <a href="https://www.fiveguys.com/"> Five Guys </a> is my favorite restaurant because of their mouthwatering burgers
            cooked to perfection, loaded with fresh toppings and served in a warm,
            toasted bun. The casual and friendly atmosphere, coupled with their 
            generous portion sizes, make dining at Five Guys a satisfying and 
            enjoyable experience. Additionally, their unlimited free toppings and
            wide selection of customizable options ensure that every visit is a 
            deliciously unique culinary adventure.

            My first choice is always the "All The Way" Double Cheeseburger, a 
            tasteful explosion of flavors and textures. I pair it with their 
            uniquely crunchy fries cooked in peanut oil, providing a savory 
            accompaniment. The meal is capped off with a creamy, vanilla milkshake.
